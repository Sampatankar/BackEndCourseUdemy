# BackEndCourseUdemy
Files from Node.js, Express, , MongoDB Udemy Bootcamp 2020

This repo contains my work on the exercises and tutorials from the Udemy: Node.js, Express, MongpDB & More Bootcamp 2020 by J. Schmedtmann.

Folders 1 to 3 are coding examples from tutorials on node.js, NPM, and JavaScript practice in Promises and Async/Await functions.

The remaining folders are a more in-depth project based on the Natours.dev website I learn to code for in the CSS course also on this Git by the same author.
Folders have code in Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, validator libraries up to and including section 8.

This will be updated as more folders are added.
