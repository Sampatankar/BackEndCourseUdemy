Files from Node.js, Express, , MongoDB Udemy Bootcamp 2020

This repo contains my work on the exercises and tutorials from the Udemy: Node.js, Express, MongpDB & More Bootcamp 2020 by J. Schmedtmann.

Folders 1 to 3 are coding examples from tutorials on node.js, NPM, and JavaScript practice in Promises and Async/Await functions.

The remaining folders are a more in-depth project based on the Natours.dev website I learn to code for in the CSS course also on this Git by the same author.
The Natours project has code in Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, validator libraries.  It looks at authentication and sanitising of data. Handling errors in Express and further advanced techniques in Mongoose together with modelling data.  We look at server-side rendering with Pug Templates.  We then look at advanced payment features and build in Stripe payment functionality.  Finally the project will be deployed through Git.
